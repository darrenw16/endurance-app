# Test Summary Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Pit Button Selector Issue ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: Tests were looking for button with text matching `/pit stop/i`
**Reality**: Button text is actually "PIT"
**Fix**: Changed selector to `/^PIT$/i` to match exact "PIT" text

### 2. Multiple Element Selection Issue ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: `screen.getByText('#42 - Test Team')` fails when multiple elements have same text
**Reality**: Team name appears in both button and heading
**Fix**: Used `screen.getAllByText('#42 - Test Team')` and check for length of 2

### 3. Import Path Issues ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: Some tests had incorrect import paths
**Fix**: Standardized imports to use relative paths correctly
